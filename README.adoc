= CDF Workshop

== Introduction

In this hands-on workshop, you will build a full OT to IT workflow for an **IoT Predictive Maintenance** use case. Below is the architecture diagram, showing all the components you will setup over the lab exercises. While the diagram divides the components according to their location (factory, regional or datacenter level) in this workshop all such components will reside in one single host.

=== Before you start

* Everything is Case-Sensitive. 
* Check all your connections and spellings

=== Pre-requisites

* Laptop with a supported OS (Windows 7 not supported).
* A modern browser like Google Chrome or Firefox (IE not supported).

=== Connecting to your cluster

. Register your access to a cluster. Instructor will give access to a registration link where you can request a cluster.

. You should have 2 addresses for you one-node cluster: the public DNS name and the public IP address. With those addresses you can test the following connectivity to your cluster. Ensure you can connect to the following service using your browser. :

|Service|URL|Credentials
|Cloudera Manager|http://<public_dns>:7180/|`admin/supersecret1`
|Edge Flow Manager|http://<public_dns>:10080/efm/ui/|
|NiFi|http://<public_dns>:8080/nifi/|
|NiFi Registry|http://<public_dns>:18080/nifi-registry/|
|Schema Registry|http://<public_dns>:7788/|
|SMM|http://<public_dns>:9991/|
|Hue|http://<public_dns>:8888/|`admin/supersecret1`
|SSB|-|`admin/supersecret1`
|CDSW|http://cdsw.<public_IP>.nip.io/|`admin/supersecret1`
|===
. We suggest you to open each of those services in one tab:

.. Edge Flow Manager
.. NiFi
.. NiFi Registry
.. Schema Registry
.. SMM
.. Hue
.. CML

Below a screenshot of Chrome open with 8 tabs, one for each service.

== Labs

Once you have all services opened in your browser, it is time to start working and see some interesting stuff!
Pick your lab and let's get started!
